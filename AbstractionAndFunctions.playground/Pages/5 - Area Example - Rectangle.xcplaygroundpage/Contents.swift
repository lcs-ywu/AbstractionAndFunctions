# Area Example - Rectangle
 
 Say that we wanted to calculate the area of a rectangle. Mathematically:
 
 ![areaRectangle](rectangle_area.png)

 Of course, this is a very simple formula to write code for – but – any time we need to calculate the area – without a function – we risk making a typo or some other error.
 
 Better to write the function *once* – then be able to use it whenever we want. That's abstraction!
 
 So, here is the *definition* of the function:
 
 */

/// Finds the area of a rectangle
/// - Parameter length: length of rectangle
/// - Parameter width: width of rectangle
/// - Returns: area of the rectangle
func areaOfRectangle(length: Double, width: Double) -> Double? {
    
    //Ensure that we have reasonable values
    guard length>0, width>0 else {
        return nil
    }
    
    return length * width
    
}

/*:
 
 Here is how we *invoke* or use the function. Try running this playground to see results:
 
 */

// Invoke the function... to find the area of a rectangle that is 10 units long and 5 units wide
//Test case #1: length:10, base:5, result:50
let result = areaOfRectangle(length: 10, width: 5)

// Report the results
print("The area of that rectangle was \(result) square units.")

//Test case #2: length:10.5, width:10, result:105
areaOfRectangle(length:10.5,width:10)

//Test case #3: length:-5, width:25, result:nil
areaOfRectangle(length:-5,width:25)

//Test case #4: length:5, width:-25, result:nil
areaOfRectangle(length:5, width:-25)

 Try option clicking on function name, where it is invoked on line 33:

 If you do not see something like the following, quit and re-open Xcode, then try again.

 When we option-click on a function that has been documented a certain way, we get useful information about how to use that function.
 
 We'll learn how to write documentation properly on the next page.
